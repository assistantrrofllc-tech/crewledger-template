# CrewLedger — Baseline Spec

**Status:** Deployed to production (Hostinger KVM 2 VPS)
**Version:** 2.1 (Phase 1 + Phase 2B + Category Management)
**Date:** February 2026
**Owner:** Admin User — Your Company

---

## 1. System Overview

CrewLedger is a field operations platform for trades companies. Module 1 ("The Ledger") replaces manual receipt collection with an SMS-based system that reads, confirms, categorizes, stores, and reports on every purchase automatically.

Employees text photos of receipts to a Twilio phone number. The system uses GPT-4o-mini Vision to extract structured data, sends a confirmation back via SMS, and saves everything to a SQLite database. Management uses a mobile-first web dashboard for oversight. The accountant receives configurable email reports and can export to QuickBooks.

### Users

| Role | How They Access | What They Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Employees (Field Crew)** | SMS (text messages) | Submit receipts by texting photos with project names |
| **Management** | Web dashboard | Oversee spending, review flagged receipts, manage employees/projects |
| **Accountant** | Email + dashboard | Configurable reports, QuickBooks/CSV/Excel export, receipt image access |

## 4. SMS Receipt Pipeline

### 4.1 Twilio Webhook

**Endpoint:** `POST /webhook/sms`

Receives all incoming SMS/MMS from Twilio. Validates signature, parses message (sender phone, body text, media URLs), routes to SMS handler, returns TwiML response. Unknown senders are logged to `unknown_contacts` table.

**Twilio fields parsed:** `From`, `Body`, `NumMedia`, `MediaUrl0..N`, `MediaContentType0..N`, `MessageSid`, `To`

### 4.2 Employee Auto-Registration

First-time texters are auto-registered by phone number. Name extracted from message using regex patterns:
- "This is Employee1" / "My name is Employee1" / "I'm Employee1" / "Employee1 here"
- Single word that looks like a name (not a common word)

If no name detected, system asks: "What's your name?"

### 4.3 Receipt Submission Flow

Employee texts `[photo] Project Alpha`. System:

1. **Downloads** the image from Twilio's media URL (authenticated with SID + token)
2. **Saves** to `storage/receipts/{firstName}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.jpg`
3. **Sends** image to GPT-4o-mini Vision API with structured extraction prompt
4. **Parses** JSON response: vendor, date, subtotal/tax/total, payment method, line items
5. **Creates** receipt record + line items in database (status: `pending`)
6. **Formats** confirmation message showing extracted data
7. **Sets** conversation state to `awaiting_confirmation`
8. **Sends** confirmation SMS back to employee

### 4.4 Confirmation Flow

Employee replies YES or NO:

**YES** (or Y, YEP, YEAH, CORRECT, LOOKS GOOD, GOOD):
- Receipt status → `confirmed`, `confirmed_at` timestamp set
- Conversation state → `idle`
- Reply: "Saved! Thanks, {name}."

**NO** (or N, NOPE, WRONG, INCORRECT):
- Receipt status → `flagged`, reason: "Employee rejected OCR read"
- Conversation state → `awaiting_manual_entry`
- Reply: Options to re-send photo or text details manually

### 4.5 Manual Entry (after NO)

Employee texts vendor/amount/date manually. System:
- Stores raw text in `context_json`
- Receipt flagged: "Manual entry — needs review"
- Conversation state → `idle`

### 4.6 Missed Receipt Flow

Detected by regex patterns: "didn't get a receipt", "no receipt", "lost receipt", "forgot receipt", "never got receipt"

System:
- Creates receipt with `is_missed_receipt = 1`, status `flagged`
- Asks employee for: store name, approximate amount, items purchased, project name
- Stores details in `context_json`
- Flagged for weekly management review

### 4.7 OCR Processing

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini Vision API
**Input:** Base64-encoded receipt image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP supported)
**Output:** Structured JSON with vendor info, date, amounts, payment method, category suggestion, line items
**Cost:** ~$0.01 per receipt (~$2-5/month at scale)

Response parsing handles:
- Markdown code block wrapping (```json ... ```)
- Numeric field coercion (string → float)
- Missing quantity defaults to 1
- Invalid JSON → returns None, receipt flagged

### 4.8 Confirmation Message Format

```
Ace Home & Supply, Anytown FL — 02/18/26 — $100.64
3 items: Utility Lighter ($7.59), Propane Exchange ($27.99), 20lb Propane Cylinder ($59.99)
Project: Sparrow

Is that correct, Employee1? Reply YES to save or NO to flag.
```

Line items capped at 5 in the confirmation SMS to keep it readable.

---

## 6. Receipt Editing & Audit Trail

Any receipt field can be edited from the dashboard. Every change is logged to `receipt_edits`:

- **Editable fields:** vendor_name, vendor_city, vendor_state, purchase_date, subtotal, tax, total, payment_method, notes, matched_project_name, project_id, category_id, status, duplicate_of
- **Audit trail:** old_value, new_value, edited_at, edited_by stored per field change

- **Receipt lifecycle actions:** Confirm (pending/flagged → confirmed), Delete (soft delete, status → deleted), Mark Duplicate (status → duplicate, optional duplicate_of reference), Restore (deleted/duplicate → pending)
- **Conversation state clearing:** When receipts are confirmed/deleted via dashboard, any stuck SMS conversation state is automatically cleared
- **Edit history** viewable per receipt via `/api/receipts/<id>/edits`

## 13. What Is NOT Built Yet

These are documented in the roadmap (`CREWOS_ROADMAP.md`) but have **no code written**:

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — Workflow file exists, needs SSH secrets configured and merge to main
- **Automated Duplicate Detection** — Manual mark-as-duplicate exists, no automatic detection yet
- **Cost Intelligence** — Unit cost tracking, anomaly detection, vendor comparison (Phase 3)
