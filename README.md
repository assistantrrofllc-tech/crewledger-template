# CrewLedger — Client Template

> This is the clean template repo for CrewLedger deployments.
> Fork this repo for each new client. The live client instance lives in a separate repo.

## Quick Start — New Client Deployment

1. Fork this repo to the client's GitHub org
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in client credentials (Twilio, OpenAI, SMTP)
3. Update `deploy/nginx/crewledger.conf` with the client's VPS hostname
4. Run `deploy/setup.sh` on the client VPS
5. Load client employee data via the dashboard or `scripts/load_sample_data.py`
6. Configure email settings from the Settings page

**The Field Operations Platform for Trades**

CrewLedger is a modular field operations platform that replaces manual receipt tracking, inventory management, and job costing with an automated, text-message-driven system built for trades companies.

---

## What It Does

Employees text a photo of their receipt to a dedicated phone number. The system reads the receipt using AI-powered OCR, confirms the details back via text, categorizes every line item, tags it to a project, and stores everything in a searchable database. Management gets a real-time web dashboard. The accountant gets a weekly email report and one-click QuickBooks export.

No app to download. No login for field crews. Just text a photo.

## Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **The Ledger** | Receipt tracking via SMS — OCR, confirmation, categorization, dashboard | ✅ Complete |
| **Inventory Tracker** | Shop supply tracking, recurring orders, low stock alerts | Planned |
| **Project Management** | Job costing, crew assignment, project timelines | Planned |

## How It Works

```
Employee texts receipt photo + project name
        |

## Features

### SMS Receipt Pipeline
- Auto-registration of new employees on first text
- GPT-4o-mini Vision OCR extracts vendor, items, totals, tax, payment method
- Confirmation flow via YES/NO text reply

- Fuzzy project matching against active projects

### Web Dashboard (Mobile-First)
- **Home** — Week total spend, comparison vs prior week, flagged count, spend breakdown by crew/card/project, recent activity feed
- **Flags** — Review queue for flagged receipts with approve/edit/dismiss actions
- **Search** — Full-text search with filters (date, employee, project, vendor, category, amount, status), pagination, CSV export
- **Employee Drill-down** — Tap any crew member to see all their receipts
- **Receipt Detail** — Tap any transaction to see full details with the actual receipt photo

### QuickBooks CSV Export
- One-click export with columns: Date, Vendor, Account, Amount, Tax, Total, Payment Method, Memo, Line Items
- Filterable by date range, employee, project, category

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Twilio account with a phone number (A2P 10DLC registered for US local numbers)
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini Vision)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/crewledger.git
   cd ClaudeCode
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy the environment template and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Required environment variables:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` — Your Twilio Account SID
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` — Your Twilio Auth Token
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` — Your Twilio phone number (E.164 format)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Your OpenAI API key
   - `APP_PORT` — Server port (default: 5001)

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_db.py
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

6. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:5001`

### Live Testing with ngrok

To receive real SMS messages from Twilio, you need a public URL:

1. Install ngrok: `brew install ngrok`
2. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and configure your authtoken
3. Start the tunnel: `ngrok http 5001`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL and set it as your Twilio webhook:
   - Go to Twilio Console → Phone Numbers → Your Number
   - Set the webhook URL to: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/sms`
   - Method: POST

### Running Tests

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

All **79 tests** should pass.
