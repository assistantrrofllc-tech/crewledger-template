# CrewLedger

**The Field Operations Platform for Trades**

CrewLedger is a modular field operations platform that replaces manual receipt tracking, inventory management, and job costing with an automated, text-message-driven system built for trades companies.

---

## What It Does

Employees text a photo of their receipt to a dedicated phone number. The system reads the receipt using AI-powered OCR, confirms the details back via text, categorizes every line item, tags it to a project, and stores everything in a searchable database. Management gets a real-time web dashboard. The accountant gets a weekly email report and one-click QuickBooks export.

No app to download. No login for field crews. Just text a photo.

## Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **CrewLedger** | Receipt tracking via SMS — OCR, categorization, dashboard, exports | ✅ Complete |
| **CrewCert** | Employee certification tracking — roster, cert CRUD, PDF splitter, CSV import | ✅ Complete |
| **CrewComms** | Cross-channel communication log (SMS, email, calls) | DB scaffold |
| **CrewSchedule** | Crew scheduling and job assignment | Planned |
| **CrewAsset** | Equipment and asset tracking | Planned |
| **CrewInventory** | Shop supply tracking, recurring orders, low stock alerts | Planned |

## How It Works

## Features

### SMS Receipt Pipeline
- Auto-registration of new employees on first text
- GPT-4o-mini Vision OCR extracts vendor, items, totals, tax, payment method
- Auto-confirm receipts (A2P pending — no outbound SMS confirmation)
- Missed receipt support (manual entry via text)
- Fuzzy project matching against active projects
- Editable submitter with audit trail

### Web Dashboard (Mobile-First)
- **Home** — Week total spend, flagged count, recent activity feed
- **Ledger** — Banking-style transaction table with filters, inline edit, status management
- **Crew** — Employee roster with certification badge summaries, search/filter
- **Crew Detail** — Employee identity card, cert CRUD, document viewer, notes
- **Admin Tools** — PDF cert splitter, bulk CSV cert import with fuzzy name matching
- **Receipt Detail** — Full details with receipt photo, edit form, audit history

### Permissions
- Module-level access control (none/view/edit/admin)
- System roles (super_admin, company_admin, manager, employee)
- Permission-gated receipt editing (edit controls hidden for view-only users)
- Defaults to allow when no auth session (scaffolding for future auth)

### QuickBooks CSV Export
- One-click export with columns: Date, Vendor, Account, Amount, Tax, Total, Payment Method, Memo, Line Items
- Filterable by date range, employee, project, category

### Weekly Email Reports
- Per-employee breakdown with receipt details
- Flagged receipt alerts
- HTML and plaintext versions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Twilio account with a phone number (A2P 10DLC registered for US local numbers)
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini Vision)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/crewledger.git
   cd ClaudeCode
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy the environment template and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Required environment variables:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` — Your Twilio Account SID
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` — Your Twilio Auth Token
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` — Your Twilio phone number (E.164 format)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Your OpenAI API key
   - `APP_PORT` — Server port (default: 5001)

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_db.py
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

6. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:5001`

### Live Testing with ngrok

To receive real SMS messages from Twilio, you need a public URL:

1. Install ngrok: `brew install ngrok`
2. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and configure your authtoken
3. Start the tunnel: `ngrok http 5001`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL and set it as your Twilio webhook:
   - Go to Twilio Console → Phone Numbers → Your Number
   - Set the webhook URL to: `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/sms`
   - Method: POST

### Running Tests

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**136 tests** should pass (1 known skip: openpyxl not installed).
