SMS message router.

Takes a parsed incoming message and decides what to do with it based on:
1. Is this a known employee? (lookup by phone number)
2. What is their current conversation state?
3. What did they send? (photo, YES/NO, text about a missed receipt, etc.)

Returns a reply string to send back via TwiML.

Steps 3-10 will plug into the hooks left here (OCR, confirmation,
project matching, categorization, etc.)
